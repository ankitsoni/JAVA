What is a Thread?
    Thread in java means 2 things.
    1 instance of class java.lang.thread
    2 thread of execution

New run() methods run on a seperate call stack.
Thread dies after run() completes execution.
Perfect way:
MyRunnable r = new Runnable()
Thread t = new Thread(r)
Same runnable can be passed to many threads.
